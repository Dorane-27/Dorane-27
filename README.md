## Hi 👋 to the new eyes here, I am a ZK Engineer and Researcher known as Fahim to the mammmals!

As former Ethereum Security Researcher, I currently do research and build Zero Knowledge Proof Systems. With an Undergraduate Degree in Energy Engineering, i want to deploy my Physics & Mathematical skills in Blockchain to particularly solve the two challenging issues: Privacy and Scalability.

For those who do not know Zero Knowledge Proofs, this are systems that use mathematical rules to authentically prove a secretive content or element without revealing it.


Upcoming projects i am currenlty working on, are Tornado-like Zk-Money Mixer and ZK Voting Protocol Sytems.
